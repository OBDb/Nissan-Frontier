  - name: "First Generation (D22)"
    start_year: 1997
    end_year: 2000
    description: "The original Nissan Frontier (replacing the Nissan Hardbody in North America) was introduced in 1997 as a compact pickup truck available in Regular and King Cab configurations, with a Crew Cab variant added in 2000. Power came from a 2.4L four-cylinder engine producing 143 horsepower, with a 3.3L V6 option generating 170 horsepower added in 1999. Transmission choices included 5-speed manual and 4-speed automatic, with both rear-wheel and four-wheel drive available. The design featured rugged, angular styling with flared fenders resembling those of the larger Titan pickup. Notable variants included the Desert Runner offering the look and raised suspension of the 4x4 with rear-wheel drive. The interior was basic but functional, focusing on durability rather than luxury, though higher trims offered amenities including air conditioning, power accessories, and upgraded audio systems. This pre-facelift model established the Frontier's reputation for durability and off-road capability at a value price point, competing primarily with the Toyota Tacoma and Ford Ranger in the compact truck segment."

  - name: "First Generation (D22 Facelift)"
    start_year: 2001
    end_year: 2004
    description: "The 2001 facelift introduced bolder styling to make the Frontier more appealing to younger buyers in its second generation. Changes included a new grille, bumper, headlights, taillights, and built-in fender flares. The regular cab was discontinued after the 2001 model year. A supercharged version of the V6 engine became available, boosting output to 210 horsepower. The Crew Cab and King Cab versions continued with updated styling details. This facelifted model maintained the same mechanical specifications as the pre-facelift, with the 2.4L four-cylinder and 3.3L V6 engines, while offering improved aesthetics and updated interior touches. The first generation concluded its run in 2004, having established the Frontier's reputation for durability and value in the competitive compact truck segment."

  - name: "Second Generation (D40)"
    start_year: 2005
    end_year: 2019
    description: "The second-generation Frontier grew substantially, moving from the compact to mid-size pickup category. Based on Nissan's F-Alpha platform shared with the full-size Titan, it featured more aggressive styling with pronounced fender flares and a bolder grille. Offered in King Cab and Crew Cab configurations, powertrain options included a 2.5L four-cylinder with 152 horsepower and a 4.0L V6 producing 261 horsepower, paired with either a 5-speed automatic, 6-speed manual, or 5-speed manual transmission depending on engine and configuration. The interior offered improved materials and design, with available features including leather seating, Rockford Fosgate audio system, and navigation in higher trims. Off-road capability was enhanced in the NISMO (later PRO-4X) models with Bilstein shocks, skid plates, and an electronic locking rear differential. Towing capacity reached up to 6,500 pounds with proper equipment. A significant update in 2009 brought refreshed styling including new wheels, updated headlights, a revised grille, rounder bumper, and improved interior materials with better quality surfaces. The NISMO model was replaced by the PRO-4X trim during this update. This pre-powertrain-update generation maintained steady sales throughout its run, appealing to buyers seeking a capable midsize truck with traditional truck values."

  - name: "Second Generation (D40 Update)"
    start_year: 2020
    end_year: 2021
    description: "The 2020 model year update marked a significant powertrain overhaul for the second-generation Frontier, introducing a new 3.8L V6 engine producing 310 horsepower and 281 lb-ft of torque, paired exclusively with a 9-speed automatic transmission. This update replaced both the outgoing 4.0L V6 and 2.5L I4 engines, representing a substantial increase in power and refinement. The manual transmission was discontinued except for the PRO-4X model in Canada. The lineup was revised: King Cab models offered both rear-wheel-drive and four-wheel-drive configurations on S and SV models; Crew Cab models extended configurations to SV short bed and SV long bed trims, while PRO-4X remained four-wheel-drive exclusively. Power windows and locks became standard on all trim levels. This update effectively bridged the gap to the upcoming third generation while maintaining the proven D40 platform and frame structure, offering customers improved performance and modern powertrain technology in a familiar package."

  - name: "Third Generation (D41)"
    start_year: 2022
    end_year: 2024
    description: "The third-generation Frontier represents the first dedicated model for the North American market, not shared with the global Nissan Navarra. Unveiled on February 4, 2021 for the 2022 model year, it features a comprehensive redesign while retaining a revised high-strength steel ladder frame chassis carried over from the outgoing D40 with substantial reinforcements for improved rigidity. The exterior adopts much more modern, aggressive styling inspired by the classic Nissan Hardbody trucks of the 1980s and early '90s, with a bold grille, distinctive LED lighting signatures, and prominent fender flares. Available in King Cab and Crew Cab configurations with 5-foot and 6-foot bed lengths, it is powered by the 3.8L V6 engine producing 310 horsepower and 281 lb-ft of torque—the most standard horsepower in the midsize truck class at introduction—paired exclusively with a 9-speed automatic transmission. Available with rear-wheel or part-time four-wheel drive with low range. The interior represents a dramatic improvement with contemporary design, higher quality materials, and modern technology including an available 9-inch touchscreen infotainment system with wireless smartphone integration, 360-degree camera system, and enhanced driver assistance features. The off-road-focused PRO-4X trim continues with Bilstein shocks, electronic locking rear differential, and additional underbody protection. Maximum towing capacity reaches 6,720 pounds, with payload up to 1,610 pounds. Trim levels include the base S, SV, and Pro-4X."

    description: "The 2025 model year brought a mid-cycle refresh to the third-generation Frontier, featuring a revised front fascia with updated grille and bumper design for a more refined appearance. Technology upgrades include a standard 12.3-inch touchscreen with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto on all trims, replacing the previous 9-inch unit. A telescoping steering wheel became standard on SV and higher trims for improved driver comfort and adjustability. New 17-inch alloy wheel designs were introduced, along with an exclusive Afterburn Orange paint color option. The long-wheelbase Crew Cab with 6-foot bed became available on SV, Pro-4X, and SL trims, expanding cargo flexibility. Safety features such as Lane Departure Warning and Blind Spot Warning were made standard across all grades. Maximum towing capacity increased to 7,150 pounds. The PRO-4X trim continues to offer off-road capability with Bilstein shocks, electronic locking rear differential, and underbody skid plates. The Hardbody Edition trim was introduced for 2024, featuring retro-inspired seventeen-inch aluminum wheels painted white and exterior details inspired by the 1980s Nissan Pickup, but the 2025 refresh represents the most comprehensive update to the D41 generation."
