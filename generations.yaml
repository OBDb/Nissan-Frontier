generations:
  - name: "First Generation (D22)"
    start_year: 1997
    end_year: 2004
    description: "The original Nissan Frontier (replacing the Nissan Hardbody in North America) was introduced as a compact pickup truck available in Regular and King Cab configurations, with a Crew Cab variant added in 2000. Power initially came from a 2.4L four-cylinder engine producing 143 horsepower, with a 3.3L V6 option generating 170 horsepower added in 1999. Transmission choices included 5-speed manual and 4-speed automatic, with both rear-wheel and four-wheel drive available. The design featured rugged, angular styling with flared fenders resembling those of the larger Titan pickup. Notable variants included the Desert Runner offering the look and raised suspension of the 4x4 with rear-wheel drive, and the supercharged SC model introduced in 2001 boosting V6 output to 210 horsepower. The interior was basic but functional, focusing on durability rather than luxury, though higher trims offered amenities including air conditioning, power accessories, and upgraded audio systems. The first generation established the Frontier's reputation for durability and off-road capability at a value price point, competing primarily with the Toyota Tacoma and Ford Ranger in the compact truck segment."

  - name: "Second Generation (D40)"
    start_year: 2005
    end_year: 2021
    description: "The second-generation Frontier grew substantially, moving from the compact to mid-size pickup category. Based on Nissan's F-Alpha platform shared with the full-size Titan, it featured more aggressive styling with pronounced fender flares and a bolder grille. Initially offered in King Cab and Crew Cab configurations, powertrain options included a 2.5L four-cylinder with 152 horsepower and a 4.0L V6 producing 261 horsepower, paired with either a 5-speed automatic, 6-speed manual, or 5-speed manual transmission depending on engine and configuration. The interior offered improved materials and design, with available features including leather seating, Rockford Fosgate audio system, and navigation in higher trims. Off-road capability was enhanced in the NISMO (later PRO-4X) models with Bilstein shocks, skid plates, and an electronic locking rear differential. Towing capacity reached up to 6,500 pounds with proper equipment. A significant update in 2009 brought refreshed styling, improved interior materials, and additional features, while a more substantial refresh in 2020 introduced the new 3.8L V6 producing 310 horsepower paired with a 9-speed automatic, previewing elements of the upcoming third generation. This generation's remarkably long production run of 16 years—unusual in the modern automotive industry—spoke to both the fundamental soundness of its design and Nissan's resource allocation priorities, with the Frontier maintaining steady sales despite its increasingly dated design compared to competitors."

  - name: "Third Generation (D41)"
    start_year: 2022
    end_year: null
    description: "The third-generation Frontier features a comprehensive redesign while retaining the proven frame from the previous generation with substantial reinforcements for improved rigidity. The exterior adopts much more modern, aggressive styling inspired by the classic Nissan Hardbody trucks of the 1980s and early '90s, with a bold grille, distinctive LED lighting signatures, and prominent fender flares. Available in King Cab and Crew Cab configurations, it comes in both 5-foot and 6-foot bed lengths depending on cab style. Powered by the 3.8L V6 engine introduced in the previous generation's final year, producing 310 horsepower and 281 lb-ft of torque—the most standard horsepower in the midsize truck class at introduction—paired exclusively with a 9-speed automatic transmission. Available with rear-wheel or part-time four-wheel drive with low range. The interior represents a dramatic improvement with contemporary design, higher quality materials, and modern technology including an available 9-inch touchscreen infotainment system with wireless smartphone integration, 360-degree camera system, and enhanced driver assistance features. The off-road-focused PRO-4X trim continues with Bilstein shocks, electronic locking rear differential, and additional underbody protection. Maximum towing capacity reaches 6,720 pounds, with payload up to 1,610 pounds. The third-generation Frontier maintains its focus on practical utility and off-road capability while addressing the primary weaknesses of its predecessor with modern styling, technology, and refinement, positioning it as a compelling option for buyers seeking a midsize truck that blends traditional truck values with contemporary features."
